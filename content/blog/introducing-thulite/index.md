We are excited to announce a name change: Hyas is now **Thulite**. The new name better suits our identity and clarifies what we stand for.

## Why the rename?

To avoid confusion/for legal reasons. HYAS is a registered trademark used for nine years by HYAS Infosec Inc. — longer than the Hyas web framework exists.

## Why Thulite?

It's a nod to Bjørn Erik Pedersen, the maintainer of Hugo, from Norway. Thulite, a rare mineral known for its striking pink color and durability, was first found in Norway. The new name symbolizes our fresh vision and the robust capabilities we bring to developers.

## What changes?

Nothing but the name. Thulite will continue to leverage the power of Hugo and npm to deliver top-notch website performance, SEO, and security.

## What's next

- [x] ~~Update all websites for the new name~~
- [x] ~~Rename the GitHub organization~~
- [x] ~~Rename the npm organization~~
{.list-task}

Thank you for using the Hyas web framework for the last five years. We hope you continue building exceptional websites with **Thulite**!
